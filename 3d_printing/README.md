*Note: all gears are 25mm tall, and have been scaled down by 50 percent when placed into their maker bot files. Leave the scaling at this 50 percent. Gears 18-30 have smaller 6-tooth gears on top of them, also 25mm tall. 


*All of the gears that say 2X thick have the full scaling of the previous gears. There is no other change other than they are twice as thick, which helps with the surface contact points between gears, allowing for less slipping and more force to be added to the system as well as potentially keeping the gears from moving on the rods.
